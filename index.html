	 <p>High School Work</p>
      <p>In High School, I was part of the International Baccalaureate programme and in my History of Americas clas, we had to create
	    a fake Non-Governmental Organization to combat a problem in the world. This is the logo I created with input with my group
	    taking inspiration from the National Atlantic Treaty Organization logo.</p>
