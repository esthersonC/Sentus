		<h1>
			Welcome to the world of Me
		</h1>
		          <p> My Name is Estherson Celestin, but I usually go by my middle name Lukas. I am a French and Haitian man with some other 
			nationalities mixed in. I enjoy mythology, comics, music (spelled as mysik), and reading. I also used to be really into 
			weapons and still have some at my home.

			<h2 style =>Hobbies</h2>
<p style = >  As I said I am a comic book fan, I plan to go watch the movie Avengers: Endgame. This movie is the end of the connected MCU which will include other heroes 
	as Iron Man or Captain America. Marvel is considered to have better movies as some movies in the DCCU (DC Cinematic Universe) have flopped
	like Green Lantern while there stand alone films like the Dark Knight, Man of Steel, etc. are good. This being said the 
	MCU(Marvel Cinematic Universe) is also considered better because of its size and movies flowing together well as it started back in 2008 
	with The Hulk.<br/><font color="red">Side Note: </font>This opinion is also heavily biased when referring to comics, although universes 
	being darker, and how movies are considered are not heavily biased but stated as pure observations. Including enjoying comics, i also 
	like to listen to music. In this respect i consider music to be the only thing that keeps me alive often enough. I enjoy listening to most tyoes
	of music and listen to artists such as Red, Linkin Park, Machine Gun Kelly, Kevin Gates, Raliegh Ritchie, SK8, and so much more.

			<h3 style =>My life</h3>
			<p align="right"><i>I do not know what else to tell about me. I am pretty random and a spur of the moment kind of person. I enjoy working
	out, and anime obviously, but also i like to do things last minute and late at night for my best work and making sure everything 
	is correct. Things such as typing up an html document is not fun but neccesary for a class such as the one i am in currently even 
	though i am certified in Adobe Dreamweaver.</i></p>
