		<p> My Name is Estherson Celestin, but I usually go by my middle name Lukas. I am a French and Haitian man with some other nationalities mixed in. I enjoy mythology, comics, music (spelled as mysik), and reading. I also used to be really into weapons and still have some at my home.</p>
<p>
As I said I am a comic book fan, i plan to go watch the movie Avengers: Endgame. This movie is the end of the connected MCU which will include other heroes as Iron Man or Captain America. would following the rules, He is like Batman in this way, employing almost any means neccesary. Marvel is considered to have better movies as some movies in the DCCU (DC Cinematic Universe) have flopped like Green Lantern while there stand alone films like the Dark Knight, Man of Steel, etc. are good. THis being said the MCU(Marvel Cinematic Universe) is also considered better because of its size and movies flowing together well as it started back in 2008 with The Hulk.<br/><font color="red">Side Note: </font>This opinion is also heavily biased when referring to comics, although universes being darker, and how movies are considered are not heavily biased but stated as pure observations.</p>

<p align="right"><i>I do not know what else to tell about me. I am pretty random and a spur of the moment kind of person. I enjoy working out, and anime obviously, but also i like to do things last minute and late at night for my best work and making sure everything is correct. Things such as typing up an html document is not fun but neccesary for a class such as the one i am in currently even though i am certified in Adobe Dreamweaver.</i></p>
